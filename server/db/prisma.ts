/*
?## WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
This file prevents multiple `PrismaClient` instances in development, where hot-reloading might cause numerous database connections that can slow down or crash the database. In production, this isn't an issue because hot-reloading doesnâ€™t occur.

?## FILE FLOW:
1. Extend TypeScript's global types using `declare global` to add a `prisma` property to `global`.
2. Check the environment: 
   - **Production**: Always create a new `PrismaClient` instance.
   - **Development**: Reuse the same instance by attaching it to `global`.
3. Export `prisma` for shared access throughout the app.

?### TypeScript Notes:
- **`declare global`**: Extends global types, adding `prisma` to the `global` object.
- **`(global as any)`**: A type assertion that allows assigning `prisma` to `global`, bypassing strict TypeScript checks.
